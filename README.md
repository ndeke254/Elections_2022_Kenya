# Constituency_results_2022
The 2022 General elections are over. The constitution outlines constituencies as the basic returning units for Presidential elections. Here is an analysis of the electoral data per county.
Some of the libraries used in the code are:

* library(data.table)-reading and writing excel/csv files
* library(dplyr) - data manipulation
* library(eeptools) - figures simulation
* library(rgdal) - read shape files
* library(echarts4r) - graphing
* library(shinycssloaders) - preloaders
* library(maps) - map zooming
* library(shinyBS) - Hover effect
